# LED Room

An off-again, on-again (mostly off-again) project to make my LED strip(s) look cool.

## Current strip setup:
5M of WS2812B individually addressable LEDs, total 300 LEDS.
See the wiring diagram for how to wire it up. Except we separate the power line for the LEDs on a 5V regular power supply.
